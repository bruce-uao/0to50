# ZGirls3 Quick-Start Guide 

#### From zero to 50 in 30 days

That's the goal of this guide, to get you to level 50 within the first 30 days of play. You should have finished the initial tutorial where you learned how to build and merge arsenals, build and merge senki, and battle for land. You will be doing a lot of these activities, but if you're looking for growth and advancement, you need a focused plan, not just randomly poking around your gakuen hoping to stumble into the next level.

The way you progress through the levels is by gaining _experience points_, and there are 3 main activities that gain you experience points:

- Research in the Teaching Building
- Building and merging buildings
- Training and merging senki

Before we get too far, let's address the elephant in the room: money. The ZGirl3 developers need to eat and pay bills like the rest of us, so they put stuff in the game to buy that (supposedly) will make it easier to play. The two most important things you need to know are:

- _You don't need to buy anything to quickly advance through the levels._
- Most of the 'payables' are trash and don't provide any great value. We'll discuss more about the best way to spend your money in the addendum.

Now, let's look at how each of 3 main activites work, then we'll make a plan to work through the levels.
## Research

The fastest way to gain experience points is by doing "research" in the Teaching Building. Research allows you to create greater level senki and arsenals, and merge your senki and arsenals to an even greater level. Let's go through the materials you will need for research and how to obtain them.

### Materials

_Note: These are not the only sources for these materials, just the most productive ones in my opinion. Be aware of other sources as you find them._

#### No. 145 tech chips

You will need _lots_ of these, but fortunately there are lots of places to find them. The most common places to find 145 chips are:

- fighting AI legions and punishers in the world \(a.k.a, the map\) and radar tasks,
- the dimensional mines,
- the sandtable exercises,
- and the expedition base battles and regular rewards.

#### Build tools

There are unique build tools for Army, Navy, & Air Force arsenals and for convenience stores. The most common places to find build tools are:

- fighting and defeating Queen Bee\-Hannah in the world and radar tasks,
- the dimensional mines,
- and tech chests.

#### Upgrade modules (for Army, Navy, & Air Force arsenals and convenience stores)

There are also unique upgrade modules for Army, Navy, & Air Force arsenals and for convenience stores. Researching with these modules will increase the level to which you can merge your arsenals and convenience stores. You can find upgrade modules:

- fighting Sea Snake\-Vera in the world and radar tasks,
- the dimensional mines,
- and tech chests.

#### Upgrade chips (for upgrading your senki)

Finally, there are upgrade chips for increasing the maximum merge level of your senki.

- fighting Black Widow\-Lis in the world and radar tasks,
- the dimensional mines,
- and tech chests.

#### Tech chests

Tech chests contain a quasi-random number of build tools, upgrade modules, and upgrade chips that are added to your inventory when you open the chest. You can obtain the chests from:

- the dimensional mines,
- radar tasks, and
- the expedition base battles and regular rewards.

The truth is there are many places that offer tech chests as a reward. It's a good practice to visit your inventory regularly and see if there are any unopened tech chests waiting for you.

#### ZCoin

Nearly everything you do will require zcoin, and research is no exception.

In my opinion, the best way to gather zcoin is to have no more than 10 convenience stores and a harvester that collects the zcoin from the stores. (The game should have had you build a harvester during the tutorials.) Just like with arsenals, be sure to merge your stores to the highest level you can.

You can also get zcoin from the Dimensional Mines. 

Another place to find zcoin is from resource collecting in the world, but in my experience resource collecting zcoin is a waste of effort that is better spent collecting oil and steel. (More on that later.)

### Process

To do research, go to the Teaching Building. Inside, you will see several tiles for the areas you can research.

- Any tile with a red dot in the corner is ready to level up.
- Any highlighted tile without a red dot needs materials like zcoin or other modules/chips/tools to level up. Tap on these tiles to see what you still need and how much.
- Any greyed-out tile requires other tiles to be leveled up first. Tap on these tiles to see what needs to be leveled up before you continue.

Use the information you get from here to prioritize what materials (listed above) you acquire.

#### Building and Merging

You should have learned how to build and merge arsenals and convenience stores from the initial tutorial. Here are some tips to maximize your results:

- Always merge your arsenals/convenience stores to the maximum level available to you. After research to raise your maximum merge level, merge your arsenals/stores and build/merge more.
- Space permitting, always do your best to have 10 convenience stores at their maximum merge level. Any stores above 10 are not active and just take up space.
- Space permitting, maintain around 20 senki arsenals for each military branch \(Army, Air Force, Navy\).
- When training senki, you should be able to have each arsenal train 4 or 5 senki. If you can't train that many because you're running out of space, either acquire more space or build fewer arsenals after your next merge.

#### Training and Merging Senki

Again, you should have learned how to build and merge senki during the initial tutorial. Here are some tips to maximize your results:

- Always merge your senki to the maximum level available to you. After research to raise your maximum merge level, merge your senki again.
- You should always be training senki. Merging will cause your number of senki to drop quickly, so you will need to replenish your supply constantly.
- After merging, delete any senki that is a lower level than your maximum arsenal level. Such senki will not be able to be merged to higher levels and are only taking up space.

#### Acquiring Land/Water for Growth

The introductory tutorial covered how to acquire land. You will need to acquire as much land space for building your arsenals and convenience stores (and water space for your navy arsenals) as you can. This will require:

- An amount of zcoin
- Senki and ZGirls strong enough to defeat enemy senki

Whenever possible, take as much land/water space you can.

# Addendum

## Spending Money

Like mentioned earlier, the ZGirls3 developers have bills to pay just like the rest of us. Consequently, they've put many places in the game to buy in-game power-ups and decorations. Most of them provide only a temporary benefit or no benefit at all, they only look pretty. When deciding when (or if) to buy something, try to determine if the item you want to buy provides value for the money you're paying.

In preparing this guide: only two items were purchased:

- _Item 1_. This gave an extra march queue, components queue _(?)_, and FuSHi queue. This can save a lot of time developing your abilities.
- _Item 2_. This gave you the option of a custom avatar. More of a vanity item, but does give the impression that you're a serious play. May be useful for potential alliance leaders.

You should be able to get good results without these purchases. Use your own discretion, just don't feel like to need to purchase anything to play the game.

## The Dimensional Mines

The Dimensional Mines are a good source of materials for research, You will have to battle mine guards (no big deal), and other players can attack you in the mines, but you won't lose anything, and your senki won't be damaged; you'll only be kicked out of that particular mine with however much materials you have mined.

## End-of-Round Checklist

This is a list of items that can (probably should) be done before leaving the game and returning to real life.

- Gather resources,
- Build/train senki,
- Put your senki on 'auto' for punisher and refugee runs,
